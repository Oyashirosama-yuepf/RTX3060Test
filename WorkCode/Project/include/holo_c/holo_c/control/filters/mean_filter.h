 * @brief
 *
 * @detail The MeanFilter is used to smoothen a series of noisy numbers, such as sensor data or the output of a function
 *         that we wish to be smoother. This is achieved by keeping track of the last k measurements (where k is the
 *         window size), and returning the average of all but the minimum and maximum measurements, which are likely to
 *         be outliers.
